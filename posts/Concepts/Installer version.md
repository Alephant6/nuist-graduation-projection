If you look closely in Settings -> About, you can find your current version and your installer version.

Installer version will not increase when you [[Update Obsidian|auto-update]], unlike the [[Current version]]. Your installer version will only increase when you install Obsidian with a new installer.

To grab the latest installer, please go to our [[official website]].

Most features can be delivered by auto-updating, but to update the engine for certain new features Obsidian, we encourage you to grab the latest installer from [our official website](https://obsidian.md) from time to time, when your current version is above the installer version by a lot, for example when your current version is 0.10.8 while installer version is 0.8.3.
