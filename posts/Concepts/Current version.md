Your current version is your Obsidian version. This is the version number that youâ€™ll see in the [[Title bar]] and the [[Vault switcher]].

You can have most of the new features and bug fixes by having an up-to-update current version. However, for some low-level updates, you might need to bring the [[Installer version]] up to date.
